### Phased Investment Approach

Rather than investing all funds at once, a phased approach is recommended to mitigate timing risk:

| Phase | Timing | BTC Allocation | ETH Allocation | Total Investment |
|-------|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Q2 2025 | $2,000 | $18,000 | $20,000 (40%) |
| Phase 2 | Q3 2025 | $1,500 | $13,500 | $15,000 (30%) |
| Phase 3 | Q4 2025 | $1,500 | $13,500 | $15,000 (30%) |

This approach allows for:
- Dollar-cost averaging to reduce entry price risk
- Flexibility to adjust strategy based on market developments
- Opportunity to capitalize on potential price dips

## 2. Entry Points Strategy

| Secondary Entry | $75,000 | Mid Q2 2025 | Key psychological level, 100-day MA |
| Opportunity Entry | $72,000 | Q2-Q3 2025 | Major support zone, 200-day MA |

### Ethereum (ETH) Entry Points

| Entry Level | Price Target | Timing | Technical Indicators |
|-------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|

| Secondary Entry | $1,700 | Mid Q2 2025 | Previous resistance turned support |
| Opportunity Entry | $1,600 | Q2-Q3 2025 | Major support zone, 200-day MA |

### Entry Strategy Implementation

![Entry and Exit Strategy](entry_exit_strategy.png)

1. **Limit Orders**: Place limit orders at each entry point to automatically execute when prices reach target levels.

2. **Contingency Plans**:
   - If BTC remains above $78,000: Execute primary entry with market orders for 40% of BTC allocation
   - If ETH remains above $1,800: Execute primary entry with market orders for 40% of ETH allocation
   - If prices surge: Wait for pullbacks to secondary support levels before entering

3. **Entry Timing**:
   - Phase 1: Enter at primary or secondary levels in Q2 2025
   - Phase 2: Enter at opportunity levels or market price in Q3 2025
   - Phase 3: Evaluate market conditions and enter at best available price in Q4 2025

## 3. Exit Strategies

### Bitcoin (BTC) Take-Profit Levels

| Take-Profit Tier | Price Target | % of Position | Justification |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | $100,000 | 30% | Key psychological resistance, 22% gain from entry |
| Tier 2 | $120,000 | 40% | Technical resistance level, 46% gain from entry |
| Tier 3 | $150,000 | 30% | Analyst target price, 83% gain from entry |

### Ethereum (ETH) Take-Profit Levels

| Tier 2 | $4,500 | 30% | Technical resistance, 136% gain from entry |
| Tier 3 | $6,000 | 50% | Analyst target price, 215% gain from entry |

### Exit Strategy Implementation

1. **Tiered Profit-Taking**: Set limit sell orders at each take-profit level for the specified percentage of the position.

2. **Trailing Stop-Loss**: Implement trailing stops of 15% for BTC and 20% for ETH once prices exceed the first take-profit level.

3. **Time-Based Exit**: Reassess positions at the end of Q4 2025 regardless of price levels, with a potential exit of remaining positions if market conditions deteriorate.

4. **Exit Timing**:
   - Begin implementing exit strategy in Q3 2025 if early targets are reached
   - Primary exit window targeted for Q4 2025
   - Extend holding period into 2026 only for final tier if market momentum remains strongly positive
